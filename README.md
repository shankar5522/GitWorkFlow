# GitWorkFlow
Here in the project we are trying to create a git workflow(like repo & branch creation etc.)

# Prerequisites.
Below are the few packages/ software should install in your system before running the scenarios.
- Pycharm 
- Pytest
- Other Dependencies you can find in requirements.txt

# Used Technique
We supposed to have below knowledge while working on this project. 
- Solution must use Python virtual environment
- Solution must use requests, pytest, pytest_bdd
- Follow rest API documentation on https://docs.github.com/en/rest

# Built With.
- The Automation framework has been designed in Python Language.

# Installation.
Below are the steps that we need to follow in order to run the project
- [Clone](https://github.com/shankar5522/GitWorkFlow.git) the project into your local system
- Simply run the project.

# Limitation or Future Enhancement.
- Currently, this project is not built upon a proper framework. so that we can achieve the same task on actual framework.
- We can pass data using scenario outline as well instead of just passing via statement.
- Does not implement any mechanism for taking screenshots.
- Able to enhance the framework more using Page Object Model [POM].
- print method could be replace with any logger mechanism


# Extra Note:
Currently in this scenario, I am only able process with login & repo creation.
I am getting a status code 200 with ok status with no branch creation.
This is very good experience to work on python language as well. But confident on it :)
